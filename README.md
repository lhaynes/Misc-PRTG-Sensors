# PRTG Sensors

This respository contains a library of Custom EXE/Script sensors for PRTG, many of which are written in PowerShell.

>If you would like a primer on using PowerShell for network automation, I authored an [article](http://packetpushers.net/no-api-no-problem/) on [PacketPushers](http://packetpushers.net) that might be helpful.

Some PowerShell sensors leverage the excellent [Posh-SSH module](https://github.com/darkoperator/Posh-SSH) from the equally excellent [Carlos Perez](https://github.com/darkoperator).
